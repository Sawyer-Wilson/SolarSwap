# Client Application

This folder contains the Front End React Application. 

## Usage

The React application can be run with 

    npm start
    
This will locally start the Front End Application at 
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Without the Server also running,
the application will not have much functionality. See the *README* in the main 
project directory for instructions on how to run the server. 

You can build the application using 

    npm build
