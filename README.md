# SolarSwap: An Online Solar Energy Marketplace

[Visit SolarSwap's website](https://www.solarswap.org)

SolarSwap is an innovative online platform designed to bridge the gap between 
those who produce excess solar energy and individuals interested in utilizing 
solar power without the installation complexities. Our service facilitates a 
unique exchange where solar energy sellers can earn additional income, while 
buyers benefit from reduced utility bills.

## Origins and Evolution
Originally conceptualized as a Tufts senior project by a collaborative team, 
it is now being developed further with an emphasis on quality and useability.
