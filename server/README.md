# Server Application

This folder contains the Express Server Application. 

## Usage

The Express application can be run with 

    node index
    
This will locally start the Server at 
[http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002). Without the Front End also 
running or being in a development environment, there will be no visual pages 
displayed. See the *README* in the main project directory for instructions on 
how to run the Front End Application or setup the production environment.
